    <b>Unit 1: The Basics of Latin</b>
    <center><h3>Lesson 1: Nouns and Their Cases and Verbs and The Indicative Mood</h3></center>
    <hr>
    <p>In this lesson, and the continuous lessons after this, you will go into the full study of Latin and how to use it. Read each lesson carefully and study the grammar rules and vocabulary listed. In this lesson, you will grasp all the different parts of nouns and verbs before actually applying them to Latin. This terms that you will see are also applied to the English language which makes them crucial for understanding Latin better. Try to understand this lesson and memorize all of the terms because the terms are what will help you understand the different parts of speech.</p>
    <br><p><b>1. Nouns and Verbs</b></p>
    <p>A. Nouns and Their Cases</p>
    <p>A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns are the main words in sentences. Without them, sentences would serve no purpose. Nouns can be divided into cases. A <b>case</b> is a single form of a noun used in a sentence, however, nouns can be used in multiple cases (not at the same time though). A noun in a sentence can be the subject, the one who is doing the action which is known as the <b>Nominative Case</b> (the land). A noun can be the owner of another noun which is known as the <b>Genitive Case</b> or the case of the possessive (of the land, the land’s). A noun can be an indirect object, or a receiver of something which is known as the <b>Dative Case</b> (to/for the land). A noun can be the direct object, or the target of an action made by the subject, which is called the <b>Accusative Case</b> [(verb) the land)]. A noun can be an object of a preposition (which means it is modified by a preposition which is a position such as in, on, against, etc...) which is known as the <b>Ablative Case</b> (by/with/from/etc... the land). A noun can be an addressed thing or person in a sentence (with exclamation) which is called the <b>Vocative Case</b> (land!). There is also another case which only applies to nouns of locations called the <b>Locative Case</b>; this case is defining where the noun is (like, at home). We will look at all of these in further lessons. You can also view these cases in grammar numbers 14-20.</p>
    <p>B. Latin Nouns and Personal Endings</p>
    <p>A noun in the English language never changes its form (except when adding the letters “s,” or “es,” occasionally when expressing more than one of the noun) but a noun in Latin changes its ending regularly depending on its use in a sentence. The varying endings are called <b>personal endings</b>. The advantage of personal endings is that identifying the subject, or any other case can be easier. The disadvantage of personal endings is the extra time to memorize and learn the endings …. at the start at least. But learning them will definitely give you a higher advantage. Since nouns in Latin have endings, there are special rules on how the endings are put on. There are five declensions of nouns, each declension with their own special set of endings for each case. Every noun in Latin that you will come across will follow one of these declensions. Each declension will include endings for the five main cases (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and Ablative) in their singular form and their plural form. The other two cases often follow one of the five standard cases. The <b>singular</b> (S.) is one (ball) and the <b>plural</b> (P.) is more than one (balls). Singular and plural are known as the <b>number</b> of a noun.</p>
    <p>C. Noun Gender</p>
    <p>In English, the only words that have gender are names of people and descriptive gender words (male, female, boy, girl, etc…). In Latin, all nouns have gender, even items and thoughts. There are three genders: <b>Masculine</b> (Masc) which is the male gender, <b>Feminine</b> (Fem) which is the female gender, and <b>Neuter</b> (Neut) which is neither Masculine nor Feminine but the neutral gender. Each declension has signature genders, but there are a few nouns that have exceptions. You will learn these rules later.</p>
    <p>D. Verbs</p>
    <p>In English, a verb follows the subject, and it is the action done by the subject or the action done to the subject. A sentence has to have a subject noun, a verb, and a direct (or indirect) object noun. A verb in English doesn’t change that often except when the verb is modified by a subject either singular or plural and when expressing a different tense. A <b>tense</b> is the time in which an action occurs. There are six tenses. The three most common tenses that we use are the <b>present tense</b> (I play), the <b>imperfect tense</b> (I was playing), and the <b>future tense</b> (I will play); these three are of the <b>present</b> system which is the system of the present. There is also the <b>perfect system</b> which is the system that expresses an action that has already happened. The tenses of this system are the <b>perfect tense</b> (I fought), the <b>pluperfect tense</b> (I had fought), and the <b>future perfect tense</b> (I shall have fought).</p>
    <p>E. Latin Verbs and Their Personal Endings</p>
    <p>All of the things that we mentioned above were in the indicative mood and active voice. There are three moods of verbs: the <b>indicative mood</b>, which is the mood expressing action, description, statements, or questions, the <b>subjunctive mood</b>, which is the mood expressing a wish or choice, and the <b>imperative mood</b>, which is the mood expressing a command. Verbs have two voices: <b>active voice</b> which is action done by the subject (I fight Tom) and <b>passive voice</b> which is action being done to the subject (I am being fought by Tom). Latin verbs also have personal endings like nouns; they have different endings for each of their moods, voices, numbers, and persons. Verbs are also divided into groups (similar to declensions) called conjugations. There are four conjugations that an individual verb can fall in, but there are some irregular verbs that will have their own conjugation. A <b>conjugation</b> is just a set of endings that a group of verbs use. Each individual verb uses only one conjugation’s set of endings ... except for a few exceptional verbs. Verbs also have numbers: singular and plural. They must agree in number and person with the noun that is expressing the action … that is if there is a noun as a subject.</p>
    <p>F. Verbs and Their Persons</p>
    <p>Unlike nouns, verbs have three persons: the <b>first person</b> is defined as I or me (plural: we), the <b>second person</b> is defined as you (plural: you or you’ll), and the <b>third person</b> is defined as he, she, it or a noun (plural: they or the plural version of the noun). All of these persons are called pronouns and in Latin they don’t have to appear physically. Latin verbs’ endings often have their persons within it, so often the subject and the verb are derived from one single Latin word. For example: <i>pugnō</i> is a Latin word which has an ending (which you will learn later) of the first-person present tense indicative active; this word can be translated into English as “I fight.” It is amazing how it takes two words to say a full sentence in English but one word in Latin!</p>
    <br><p><b>2. The Indicative Active</b></p>
    <p>Our main focus, for the first few lessons, is the indicative mood, which is an action that a noun does, and the active voice, which is the actions done by the subject noun. One thing to understand about Latin sentences is that the subject is always first (if there is a noun subject at least). The verb is always last in every Latin sentence, but it should proceed after the sentence it is used in if there two or more sentences joined together; don’t put all the verbs at the end of a compound sentence, or else the translation would get messed up. You will learn more about this later on. This whole lesson was to grasp the two different parts of speech and so all of the information should be remembered and memorized. You will apply what you have learned in the next lesson. Do exercise 1 to review what you have just read.</p>
    <p>Next up: <b>Exercise 1</b>.</p>
    <p>(Whenever you see this, it means that you should go to the exercise section of this course and write down the answers in a notebook. This will help strengthen your Latin knowledge and this will help you read and write Latin better.)</p>
    <p>If you still don’t understand everything mentioned in the lesson, you should not worry. As you continue learning each concept of Latin, you will be reviewed with these terms again in greater depth. This lesson basically covered the important English grammar rules that must be at least recognized.</p>
