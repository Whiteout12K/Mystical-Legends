    <hr>
    <p>Latin used to be spoken by the Roman Citizens and the Roman government ... and anyone who wanted to learn it at that time. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Latin was still spoken but soon it was replaced by other newer languages which still used many of the vocabulary and grammar rules of Latin. Latin, today, is rarely used as a form of communication, but it is used today significantly for scientific terms or education. There are still some very good benefits for learning Latin today: Latin can help your mind function and memorize easier, Latin can enhance your English vocabulary and grammar, Latin (and all other languages) can help your mind to think more in-depth, and Latin can help you learn future languages easier and quicker.</p>
    <br><p><b>1. How to Study Latin</b></p>
    <p>Latin is not the same as English for many reasons. You will be shown this later. Here are a few tips on learning the different parts of Latin: </p>
    <p><b>A. The Text: </b>It is very important that, when you are learning Latin through the text, you read each section of each lesson slowly and carefully so that you can understand it completely. Reading it over and over again helps you grasp the concepts better.</p>
    <p><b>B. Vocabulary: </b>You will get new Latin words every lesson (shown in a table under the title of vocabulary), it is a good idea to memorize all of the words. One of the best ways to memorize every word is to make flashcards with the English word on one side and the Latin word on the other. Once you do that, you can use the cards however many times until you have placed the Latin word (and the English meaning) into your long-term memory. It also helps for someone else to review the Latin words with you verbally; they can do this by reading off one side of the flashcard for you to translate. Reading Latin verbally helps your brain grasp the word better and it allows you to start understanding how a word sounds rather than only how it looks in letter form on a piece of paper.</p>
    <p><b>C. Grammar Rules: </b>There are many rules for Latin that have to be memorized, just like some tricky and sort of annoying English grammar rules today. It is important to memorize all of the rules (not word for word though, but rather the general meaning). Appendix A is where you will find the most important grammar rules that must be memorized, but if this is your first time, then you won’t understand what most of it is until you read through each lesson scattered in the next pages.</p>
    <p><b>D. Exercies: </b>There are also exercises included in this book that will train your mind to recognize and easily understand sentences in Latin. And the best way to translate them is to know the grammar rules and the vocabulary. For starters who are translating a Latin sentence, it is easier to first define each word and their meanings before putting them together in a complete sentence. This method is called parsing and it will be explained in more depth later on in the lessons.</p>
    <p><b>E. Getting Good at Latin: </b>If you want to be better at Latin (as in being fluent in it or able to read a full book in Latin) then you will have to do more than what is assigned and actively use Latin in your normal life. Vocabulary and grammar are the keys to getting good at Latin.</p>
    <p><b>F. What is the Purpose of this Course?: </b>This course is designed to have all of the most important concepts of Latin taught in a short amount of time, but really it is up to you what pace you want to move through the course. You don’t want to rush too fast over each concept without having practice which is what the exercise in this course are designed for.</p>
    <p>This course is also designed to be more of a guide that you use to refer to things that you don’t understand. The vocabulary charts in this course give some of the most important and widely used Latin terms that are worth memorizing if you do not know them. There is even a Latin dictionary of all the Latin words used in this course located in one of the links on the main navigation bar. The exercises help you see the Latin words and grammar rules in use if you need reference.</p>
    <br><p><b>2. The Latin Alphabet and Pronuciations</b></p>
    <p>The standard Latin alphabet has all the letters of the English alphabet but <b>w</b> and <b>y</b>. Some newer Latin words of the modern era contain all the letters of the English alphabet. <b>Note</b>: The Latin alphabet and letters don’t really need to be memorized or remembered since the letters are identical to the ones in English. The first thing that you should know about Latin is the Latin pronunciations. Here is a brief explanation in the graph:</p>

    <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;padding:10px;overflow:auto;" width="100%">
      <thead>
          <tr>
              <th colspan="2">Vowels</th>
              <th colspan="2">Other Letters</th>
              <th rowspan="2">Diphthongs</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <th>Short</th>
              <th>Long</th>
              <th>Short</th>
              <th>Long</th>
          </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
              <td><b>a</b> as in f<u>a</u>cility</td>
              <td><b>ā</b> as in n<u>a</u>ughty</td>
              <td><b>j</b> as in <u>y</u>es</td>
              <td></td>
              <td><b>ou</b> as in <u>ou</u>t</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>e</b> as in j<u>e</u>t</td>
              <td><b>ē</b> as in th<u>e</u>y</td>
              <td><b>g</b> as in <b>g</b>em</td>
              <td><b>g</b> as in <b>g</b>reat</td>
              <td><b>ae</b> or <b>ou</b> as in th<u>e</u>y</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>i</b> as in m<u>i</u>tten</td>
              <td><b>ī</b> as in mach<u>i</u>ne</td>
              <td><b>c</b> as in <u>c</u>eiling</td>
              <td><b>c</b> as in <u>c</u>ar</td>
              <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>o</b> as in l<u>o</u>t</td>
              <td><b>ō</b> as in l<u>o</u>w</td>
              <td><b>v</b> as in ho<u>w</u></td>
              <td><b>r</b> as in <u>r</u>olled</td>
              <td></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>u</b> as in g<u>u</u>tter</td>
              <td><b>ū</b> as in je<u>w</u>el</td>
              <td><b>h</b> is usually silent</td>
              <td></td>
              <td></td>
          </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <p>All other letters of the alphabet that aren’t listed are pronounced the same as how you would normally in English. <b>Note</b>: if you want to the table below later, then go to grammar number 1 (whenever you see this, it means, go to the grammar section of the online course, Appendix A: Grammar Rules, and then go to the assigned number). Once you have gotten the hang of the basic pronunciations, then you may move on. <b>Note</b>: There are more ways to pronounce each Latin vowel and especially the word, so you can find more information in other books or online. More information on pronunciations can be located at the first few numbers of the grammar rules appendix. </p>
  <p>Whenever you see a macron (“-” which are found above vowels), always memorize where they belong on a word because it is crucial for identifying the role of a word or the type of word itself. You should always place the correct corresponding macron on each Latin word in the exercises. You will see some words that have macrons and some words that don’t have macrons. The macron is also a pronunciation mark which tells you where a vowel needs to be long instead of short.</p>
