<h1>v0.4 Status Update</h1>
<q>The time approaches!</q>
<p>This infopage is to keep you informed of what is currently established in the work-in-progress game. Mystical Legends is currently in development, but will be released once done. You can expect a whole new experience when you play.</p>

<h2>Beta: Campaign</h2>

<p>The gameplay of <b>Campain</b> has been established. You will be able to fight with various weapons. You can even upgrade various weapons. A vast location, and other locations, have been made with a lot of interactive pieces.</p>

<h2>Menu</h2>
<p>The entire lobby for <b>Battle Royal</b> has been made and ready to go. Some aspects are still in work in progress such as the game selector. However, you can access the entire inventory of all the items that you have collected.</p>

<h2>Season Pass</h2>

<p>There will be season passes that you will be able to grind through. All of them have been made (though you will not know what they are until they are released). Each season will last about a few months or more.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more to come ... and the official game release!</p>
